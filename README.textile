h1. Purpose

Ever wondered how to utilize views easily in e.g. a dialog to let the use select a row out of a complex view with filters and all that?
Well think about just using a table style which lets you set a Javascript callback and let you select a column of the fields as the value.

When the user clicks a row, your callback gets called and the first parameter will be the value, the second the row itself (for whatever you want to do with it).
Thats it!

h1. Installation

# Activate the module
# Clear the cache. thats it!

h1. Usage

# Create a view.
# Select "Table select" as style plugin
# Go to the options form and set the usual table things like order etc. and 
## Set the callback. This javascript method will be called, if a row gets selected
## select a column out of the current fields, which will be passed as value

Your done, thats it :)
